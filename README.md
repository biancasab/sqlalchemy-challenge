# sqlalchemy-challenge

This is my submission for module 10 challenge of the UCI Bootcamp. 

climate_starter.ipynb contains my precipitation analysis and station analysis. Python, SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib was used to do so. 

app.py contains the climate app. Flask was used to create routes to different pages that shows the results of the precipitation and station analyses. 

Note: for the last two API endpoints:
- /api/v1.0/start - please insert start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- /api/v1.0/start/end - please insert start and end date (YYYY-MM-DD)
